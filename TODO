DONE

	Worked out how to run provider locally. Gross.

	Customer is working but it seems if "debug" is omitted, it gets into a loop where it keeps trying to change debug value to 1.

	What is going on with the debug flag for customers?

	Fixed. Just needed defaults and to be marked computed.

	There is a problem with relay keypair. It seems that the relay keypair create is not returning correct values?

	Also, once the relay keypair is thought to be created, the api can't read it:

		"The network next API returned an error: could not read relay keypair: pq: column "relay_keypair_id" does not exist"

	Looks like the relay keypair resourec is totally fucked, but it looks like it's probably broken on the API side.

	Relay keypair was totally broken. Making progress fixing it, I don't think it ever worked...

	Yes. It was totally broken.

	Relay resource looks fine.

	Route shader resource creates, but the list of route shaders doesn't seem to be correct.

	Copy paste bug in provider model.

	Apply the same fixes to the buyer keypair

	Buyer keypairs is returning NULL.

	Wrong model data was set on buyer keypair post create. fixed.

	All resources and data work fine.

TODO

	Add the relay keypair to the API func test. Clearly it was never properly tested.

	Add buyer keypair to API func test as well.

	-------------

	Work out how to publish the provider

	-------------

	Implement a functional test using the published provider
